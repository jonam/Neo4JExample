This example tests:

1. Adding a node to Neo4J
2. Adding a simple property to a node.
3. Creating an index in Neo4J
4. Adding the node, property and value to the index.

The step 4 does not seem to work in 1.8-SNAPSHOT of Neo4J.
It does work in 1.7 of Neo4J.

Perhaps, we are doing something wrong. Or some new code needs to
be written to make this code work.

Submitted this code to Build Doctor, and Peter Neubauer for review
via twitter.
